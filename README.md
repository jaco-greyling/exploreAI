# Undertanding how I solve ML problems :) 

Please feel free to navigate through my codebase. I consider myself as Data Scientist with strong Software Engineering skills. 

I typically make usee of the following patterns and tools: 
- fit(), predict() pattern from sklearn.
- OOP design principles
- modular components to scale horizontally and vertically
- pre-commit hooks to keep my code and commits clean and readable.
- experiment tracking using MLFLow
- XAI (see my notebook)

TODO's: 
- Containerise solution
- CI/CD pipelines
- Examples using code
- Docs
